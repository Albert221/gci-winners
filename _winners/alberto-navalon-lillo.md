Hello! I'm Alberto, from Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸. I worked (and somehow won) with Apertium during GCI 2018 (cheers Andi :D). I love coding, reading, maths, chess, and Rubik's cubes. Actually, I think I spend more time cubing than doing the rest of the stuff altogether. I don't watch any series/movies so please don't ask me about it, because I won't be able to hold the conversation for too long.

Anyway, thanks for coming to my TED talk.
