Hey, Iâ€™m a 17 year old student from New Delhi, India. I specialise in backend development and I code mainly in Python and Javascript. I also have a good sense of color schemes so sometimes I create aesthetic designs :P. I have spent most of my childhood in developing my interest towards the functionality of the web but when I'm not coding, I like to read about the trends and the companies across the globe associated with technology. This inspires me to think out of the box and produce efficient solutions.
