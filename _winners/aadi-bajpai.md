Hey! I'm Aadi. I like programming, designing and writing although I don't usually have time to do all 3 at once. I've been working with Python a lot, since it allows me to explore domains ranging from application development to cryptography. I'm curious about a lot of things and love exploring the fine lines between multiple disciplines. I've been developing an interest towards technology from the perspective of privacy and anonymity. I like treasure hunts (and by extension CTFs!), music and have been known to dabble in competitive programming as well. You can view some of the stuff I do over at GitHub or Dribbble and feel free to reach out to me!
