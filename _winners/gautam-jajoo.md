Hey, I am Gautam Jajoo, a 17 year old high school student from New Delhi. I am a frontend developer and an Open Source enthusiast. I love designing stuffs too. I have been contributing to CloudCV since 2017. I have also participated in many techfests, interschools and quizzes which have helped me to gain some experience in this field. Apart from coding, I am interested in Poetry, Politics and Finance. I also have a huge interest in Quantum Mechanics.
