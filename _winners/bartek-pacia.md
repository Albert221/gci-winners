Hey, I'm Bartek and I like making computers do various things. I mainly code, but sometimes I like to play some games. Aside from programming, I like tanks, history, and listening to music. Oh, and I just love simply being out in nature (did I mention Geocaching?). Feel free to talk to me about anything!
