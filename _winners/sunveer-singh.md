Hey Folks, I am 17 year old Open Source Developer from Punjab, India. I like to play with Kotlin in mobile and currently on my way to learn Flutter. I like to do desiging as well but I give my more time to android mostly. I am always open to learning new things. Feel free to hit me up anywhere on the platforms below.
